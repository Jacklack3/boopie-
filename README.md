"boopie!" is a multi-purpose Discord bot. Currently it's small but is planned to have lots of useful and fun features.
## How to set it up.

You'll  be sent to "glitch.com" and you have remixed/fork the repo. Now you're gonna get your bot's token and click on the `.env` file on the right (with the key beside it).

You'll see on the right there will be something that says `TOKEN=`, paste your token beside it so it's `TOKEN=(your token here)`.

Glitch.com automatically runs the bot as you type so after you do the above you're done. You can sign into your GitHub account on the top right so you can save your project.
